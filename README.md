# Intern-Bosch.io-Task
Task Description:

Please create a simple web page using HTML, CSS and plain JS(no libraries are allowed). 
The page should contain 6 products and on click of a product, a popup with additional info should appear.
Only DESKTOP screens should be suported. Donâ€™t worry about mobile views.
The solution can be sent like a .zip or better send us a link to a Github repository.

Using SCSS instead of plain CSS will be taken as an advantage.
